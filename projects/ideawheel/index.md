At the suggestion of the eminent [Lunostophiles](https://twitter.com/lunostophiles), we started investigating ways to come up with writing prompts.  Through further discussion, we settled on the idea of having idea fragments that could be received at random and strung together to form a coherent idea that could be used as a prompt for a story, a piece of art, or the like.  For instance, one might get the fragments "cries for help" and "the dark behind the fridge" and come up with a neat horror story.
