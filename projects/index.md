OpenFurry runs, facilitates, incubates, or otherwise gets its paws in a variety of open-source projects, primarily designed for the web.  Existing projects include:

* [Addle](addle)

  A pluggable advertising framework which allows sites to manage and sell their own ad spaces.  Also functions as a standalone app via an API.
* [Charref](charref)

  A place to quickly store visual and textual references of fictional (or even real-life) characters, aiming to be the link you give an artist when commissioning them.
* [Honeycomb](honeycomb)

  Furry, and even other creative groups, lack sites focused solely on writing.  There are galleries, to be sure, which allow written works, but nothing intended solely for that purpose.  To that end, and with input from the FWG, Honeycomb was born.
* [Ideawheel](ideawheel)

  Need an idea?  Ideawheel lets one collect disparate fragments of ideas into something worth pursuing as the core to a project, written or otherwise.
* [OFAuth](ofauth)

  With ~~so many~~ too many projects floating around within OpenFurry, a centralized single sign-on service was called for, so that users could log in to OF projects from one place.
* [Submitify](submitify)

  A centralized, social, multi-format, all-in-one site for managing calls for submissions, submitting to the same, and organizing submission reviews and notifications.
* [Yipsum](yipsum)

  Filler text for the modern furry.

## New projects

Pitches, partially, or fully completed projects are always welcome to be included under the OpenFurry umbrella.  Projects need not be furry in nature or even intended for a furry audience, but should have some tie to the fandom. This can be to one of its "tenets", such as they are, such as the core value of creativity and expression; to an individual such as the project maintainer as a member of the fandom; or to the utility to other furry projects within and outside OpenFurry

OpenFurry projects receive:

* A community of developers to aid in development, testing, and QA of projects
* A community of users to build the membership within projects
* A core set of applications - SSO, advertising, and pluggable apps - to help tie everything together and cross-promote

OpenFurry's requirements for projects are that they:

* Abide by the [OpenFurry code of conduct](/code-of-conduct)
* Be outstanding examples of open-source projects with a firm process in place (use PRs, CI, tests and coverage, packaging, etc.)
* Respect user security, privacy, and existing tooling and best practices
