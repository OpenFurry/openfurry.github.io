* [Charref](charref)

  A place to quickly store visual and textual references of fictional (or even real-life) characters, aiming to be the link you give an artist when commissioning them.
* [Ideawheel](ideawheel)

  Need an idea?  Ideawheel lets one collect disparate fragments of ideas into something worth pursuing as the core to a project, written or otherwise.
* [Yipsum](yipsum)

  Filler text for the modern furry.
* [Honeycomb](honeycomb)

  Furry, and even other creative groups, lack sites focused solely on writing.  There are galleries, to be sure, which allow written works, but nothing intended solely for that purpose.  To that end, and with input from the FWG, Honeycomb was born.
* [OFAuth](ofauth)

  With ~~so many~~ too many projects floating around within OpenFurry, a centralized single sign-on service was called for, so that users could log in to OF projects from one place.
* [Submitify](submitify)

  A centralized, social, multi-format, all-in-one site for managing calls for submissions, submitting to the same, and organizing submission reviews and notifications.
