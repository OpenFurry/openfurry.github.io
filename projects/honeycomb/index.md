The inspiration for Honeycomb came from a discussion among members of [The Furry Writers' Guild](https://furrywritersguild.com) on what an ideal writing site should be.  It should be:

* easy to post one's work,
* easy to interact socially with other users,
* easy to promote works to others through promotions or editor highlights,
* easy to organize work through tags and folders,
* easy to discover new authors and their work, and
* easy for publishers to maintain a presence through pages and advertising.

From out of the FWGs discussions came a specification, which was picked up by OpenFurry as a project.  The intent was to provide an implementation and website for use by the furry subculture.  The project was open-sourced to allow other communities of writers and readers to use it and contribute as well.

The name references the common area within the rabbits' warren in the book *Watership Down* and is intended to evoke a sense of a comfortable place of community and creativity.
