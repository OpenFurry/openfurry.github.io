OpenFurry is a loose collective of critters interested in making neat software.  Though many may [contribute](https://Github.com/orgs/OpenFurry/teams/contributors), here are some of the folks involved.

Contributors are bound by OpenFurry's adaptation of [the contributor covenant code of conduct](/code-of-conduct).

## Primary

* **Makyo - Madison Scott-Clary**{: id="Makyo" } ![Art by Rory Frances](/assets/headshots/makyo.png){: style="width: 150px; float: right;" }

  Makyo is totally and completely obsessed with, inundated by, and buried underneath furry.  She's an arctic fox 80% of the time, a snow leopard 15% of the time, an Ethiopian wolf 3% of the time, and the other 2% she's a human working on [Juju](https://jujucharms.com) at [Canonical](https://canonical.com).

  **Languages**

  * Python
  * Go
  * JavaScript (*ask her about D3~*)
  * JS transpiled languages - CoffeeScript and Elm

  **Specialties**

  * Django and Flask apps
  * Extensive Jekyll sites
  * Data visualization
  * Process - tasks, issues, CI, coverage, etc. (*number one process maven*)
